# README-Generator

 ## Description

  This is a README Generator that helps us to quickly create a professional README for a new project. The generator collects user input and create a Readme markdown with the title of the project and sections entitled Description, Table of Contents, Installation, Usage, License, Contributing, Tests, and Questions.

  ## Installation

  To run this project we need to install Node.js. Then create a `.gitignore` file and include `node_modules/` and `.DS_Store/` so that your `node_modules` directory isn't tracked or uploaded to GitHub. We need `package.json` with the required dependencies. You can create one by running `npm init` when you first set up the project, before installing any dependencies.
